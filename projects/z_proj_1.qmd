This project focused on comparing the predictive abilities of different classes of sabermetric statistics in sports. Using 2025 WNBA data, I developed classification models with the goal of predicting a win/loss outcomes.

Sport fans will be familiar with the divide between classic, "old-school" statistical categories and new, "sabermetric" metrics designed to be a more advanced indicator of performance. Often, one set of these statistics will be favored over others, by both casual fans and award voters alike. 

This project seeks to determine whether advanced or basic team statistical categories in sports is more predictive of team success at the team level. The resulting [report](/inprogress.qmd) will show the modeling strategies, test outputs, and corresponding conclusions.
