### Project Overview

Financial stability has been strongly associated with quality of life across a number of metrics, and can serve as an important and more quantifiable indicator of well-being for policy makers. By determining the extent to which a person's childhood socioeconomic environment predicts their financial success in adulthood, we lay the groundwork to direct future social welfare interventions to target the most under-served demographic groups.

Using publicly available credit availability data from the [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/data/) organization, we combined the results from non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis tests, multiple regression, and Random Forest models to assess how racial and intergenerational factors lead to differential economic prosperity in adulthood, as measured by debt delinquency rate. We combined this data with local education rates to construct a fuller picture of socioeconomic context, which was included as predictor. 

We found that parental income is a significant predictor of debt delinquency rates in adulthood across the $25^{\text{th}}$, $50^{\text{th}}$, and $75^{\text{th}}$ percentile groups. Children from wealthier families are more likely to have better financial health.

These findings were repeated when considering the broader childhood social environment; in addition, we found that there were highly significant differences by race/ethnicity, and significant but limited effects from local college education rates.

As such, we recommend that financial well-being measures be targeted towards less wealthy families from typically disadvantaged race/ethnicities. The full results are compiled into a formal [report](proj_files/proj_debtdelinquency/DebtDelinquency_Report_MasonKellerman.pdf) which contains a more detailed background, literature review, and analytical methodology. We designed a conference [poster](proj_files/proj_debtdelinquency/DebtDelinquency_Poster_MasonKellerman.pdf) and  [slides](proj_files/proj_debtdelinquency/DebtDelinquency_Slides_MasonKellerman.pdf) used in a presentation.
