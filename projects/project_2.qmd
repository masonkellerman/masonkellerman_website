In the upcoming 2026 MLB season, we will see the introduction of an automatic ball/strike (ABS) system which will allow players to "challenge" the human umpires' ball/strike calls by appealing to a computerized system. However, since this has never been used at the major league level, optimal (and demonstrated) strategy is yet to be solidified.

This project aims to create a statistical framework for assessing the optimal strategy around using ABS challenges, with reference to game situation (and optionally player and team tendencies as well). 

This research is summarized into a pdf [report](/inprogress.qmd), and used to develop an `python`-based interactive [tool](/inprogress.qmd) to visualize and experiment with different factors. This dashboard could allow teams and analysts to more easily understand ABS challenge behaviors.
