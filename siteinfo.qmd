The current build is from `r format(Sys.time(),'%d %B %Y')`.

The website was created by me using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) pages. It is hosted with [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/), and the source code can be found on the public GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/masonkellerman/masonkellerman_website/). 

The site typeface is [Atkinson Hyperlegible Next](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible+Next), an accessibility-focused design created by the Braile Institute (more information [here](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/)). 

Significant thanks to [Jose Toledo Luna](https://toledo-luna.com/)'s instructions, which provided much needed instruction.
