Since the data is split by U.S. county, we also investigate differences across state and county, incorporating limited environmental factors such as county-level racial diversity.\nWe compiled a report that contains our findings in more detail, and designed a poster to effectively communicate these results to a mass audience. A set of slides was also created for an in-class presentation.\ntools used: R, LaTeX, Quarto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphical results (to be updated later):"

Using 2025 WNBA data, I developed classification models with the goal of predicting a win/loss outcomes.\nSport fans will be familiar with the divide between classic, “old-school” statistical categories and new, “sabermetric” metrics designed to be a more advanced indicator of performance. Often, one set of these statistics will be favored over others, by both casual fans and award voters alike.\nThis project seeks to determine whether advanced or basic team statistical categories in sports is more predictive of team success at the team level. The resulting report will show the modeling strategies, test outputs, and corresponding conclusions.\ntools used: R, LaTeX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphical results (to be updated later):"

However, since this has never been used at the major league level, optimal (and demonstrated) strategy is yet to be solidified.\nThis project aims to create a statistical framework for assessing the optimal strategy around using ABS challenges, with reference to game situation (and optionally player and team tendencies as well).\nThis research is summarized into a pdf report, and used to develop an python-based interactive tool to visualize and experiment with different factors. This dashboard could allow teams and analysts to more easily understand ABS challenge behaviors.\ntools used: R, python, Quarto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphical results (to be updated later):"
