Using 2025 WNBA data, I developed classification models with the goal of predicting a win/loss outcomes.\nSport fans will be familiar with the divide between classic, “old-school” statistical categories and new, “sabermetric” metrics designed to be a more advanced indicator of performance. Often, one set of these statistics will be favored over others, by both casual fans and award voters alike.\nThis project seeks to determine whether advanced or basic team statistical categories in sports is more predictive of team success at the team level. The resulting report will show the modeling strategies, test outputs, and corresponding conclusions.\ntools used: R, LaTeX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphical results (to be updated later):"

By determining the extent to which a person’s childhood socioeconomic environment predicts their financial success in adulthood, we lay the groundwork to direct future social welfare interventions to target the most under-served demographic groups.\nUsing publicly available credit availability data from the Opportunity Insights organization, we combined the results from non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis tests, multiple regression, and Random Forest models to assess how racial and intergenerational factors lead to differential economic prosperity in adulthood, as measured by debt delinquency rate. We combined this data with local education rates to construct a fuller picture of socioeconomic context, which was included as predictor.\nWe found that parental income is a significant predictor of debt delinquency rates in adulthood across the \\(25^{\\text{th}}\\), \\(50^{\\text{th}}\\), and \\(75^{\\text{th}}\\) percentile groups. Children from wealthier families are more likely to have better financial health.\nThese findings were repeated when considering the broader childhood social environment; in addition, we found that there were highly significant differences by race/ethnicity, and significant but limited effects from local college education rates.\nAs such, we recommend that financial well-being measures be targeted towards less wealthy families from typically disadvantaged race/ethnicities. The full results are compiled into a formal report which contains a more detailed background, literature review, and analytical methodology. We designed a conference poster and slides used in a presentation.\ntools used: R (RStudio), LaTeX (Overleaf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphical results: Tables and Figures\nA code book for the data set I created, combining the Opportunity Insights data with U.S. state and county FIPS identity codes and county-level four-yera college education rates. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(download the .tex source file for the report here, and for the poster here)"

However, since this has never been used at the major league level, optimal (and demonstrated) strategy is yet to be solidified.\nThis project aims to create a statistical framework for assessing the optimal strategy around using ABS challenges, with reference to game situation (and optionally player and team tendencies as well).\nThis research is summarized into a pdf report, and used to develop an python-based interactive tool to visualize and experiment with different factors. This dashboard could allow teams and analysts to more easily understand ABS challenge behaviors.\ntools used: R, python, Quarto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphical results (to be updated later):"
