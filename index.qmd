I currently attend the **University of California, Los Angeles**, and will be graduating this spring with *Psychology, B.A.* and *Statistics & Data Science, B.S.* degrees, with a minor in Educational Studies. 

My focus is on designing effective measures/assessments for teacher and student evaluation, which enable quasi-causal conclusions about underlying features and facilitate constructive educator training and school policy. I care about making a positive impact on individuals with my work through affecting institutional progress. More information about me can be found in my [resume](/resume.pdf).

I am interested in opportunities that further this vision; I appreciate all outreach :)
