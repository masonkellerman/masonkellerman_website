I currently attend the **University of California, Los Angeles**, and will be graduating this spring with *Psychology, B.A.* and *Statistics & Data Science, B.S.* Degrees, and a minor in Educational Studies. 

My focus is on the ways in which we can use targeted data collection and analysis techniques to learn about how people learn. I am interested in ways of quantifying different aspects of education and learning, to direct structural interventions which affect the most benefit. I care about improving the lives of individuals through institutional progress. More information about me can be found in my [resume](/resume_MasonKellerman.pdf).

I am interested in opportunities that further this vision; I appreciate all outreach :)
